A California manufacturing company is considering expansion by building a new factory in either Los Angeles or San Francisco, or perhaps even in both cities. It also considering building at most one new warehouse, but the choice of location is restricted to a city where a new factory is being built. The net present value (total profitability considering the time value of money) of each these alternatives and the capital required (already included in the present value) for the respective investment are given in the table.

Decision Number Yes-or-No Question Decision Variable Net Present Value Capital Required

| Decision Number | Yes-or-No Question               | Decision Variable | Net Present Value | Capital Required |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1               | Build factory in Los Angeles?    | x1                | $9 million        | $6 million       |
| 2               | Build factory in San Francisco?  | x2                | $5 million        | $3 million       |
| 3               | Build warehouse in Los Angeles?  | x3                | $6 million        | $5 million       |
| 4               | Build warehouse in San Francisco?| x4                | $4 million        | $2 million       |

Capital Available=  $10 million

Find the feasible combination of alternatives that maximizes the total present value.
